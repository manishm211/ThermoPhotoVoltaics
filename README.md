# Thermophotovoltaics
This repository contains the Python and Excel files for my Thermophotovoltaics research project.

1. The file 'Optimization_and_CO2_emissions.py' contains the code to calculate and optimize the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) and Electricity (LCOE_el) by following the energy management algorithm from the original study (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.113935) along with our modifications according to our needs. It imports the Excel file 'TPV.xlsx' that contains the hourly electricity consumption and solar PV generation data for a residential building in Boone, Iowa. The Python file also plots the base-case and optimized LCOE and LCOE_el. It also calculates the CO2eq. emissions for a building with no energy storage system and base-case and optimized energy storage systems with a TPV unit.
2. The file 'Monte_Carlo_uncertainty_analysis.py' performs the Monte Carlo uncertainty assessment on some input parameters by importing their historical data from the literature (from the Excel file 'Monte_Carlo_parameters.xlsx'). It then fits a probability distribution to each parameter and supplies their values to the model to calculate LCOE. Then, it plots the probability distribution and cumulative distribution functions for LCOE (for an optimized system).
